# Predicting Housing Prices in Green Bay, WI

## Goal
The main purpose of this analysis is to predict housing prices for houses
</br>
in the greater Green Bay area.

## Database
The homes3.xlsx was created using the Zillow to Excel Google Chrome Extension.<br/>
9 major areas in the greater Green Bay area were selected (Green Bay, Ashwaubanon, 
</br>
Bellevue, Allouez, De Pere, Hobart, Pulaski, Suamico, and Howard) for homes listed 
</br>
in these areas. These homes were then exported into an excel spreadsheet with important 
</br>
specifications.

## The Data
### General Info
There are 1,215 records making this a relatively  small dataset. There are 23 variables. The data was generated by using the Zillow to Excel Google Chrome Extension. Each of the Green Bay areas were filtered through (40 was the max per filter). Then in each area, I ran through 1 bedroom, 2 bedrooms, etc. up to 5 bedrooms to capture as many possibilities in each area. They were then all compiled into a single excel spreadsheet.

### Target
Our target variable will be the "Price" variable
